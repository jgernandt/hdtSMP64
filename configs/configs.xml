    <!--
      useRealTime: (boolean) when enabled, use the RealTime clock instead of
      the WorldTime clock.
      This is quite a conceptual change: the physics are calculated not
      depending on what we think is the inner game clock, but depending on what we
      think is the external real clock. Theoretically this should be a worse choice,
      as we calculate physics for the game world with its own world clock. But the
      preliminary tests show a better stability of the physics simulation when the
      game time is strongly slowed, when the fps are high (for example 100+), and of
      course with a combination of both. My hypothesis for this better physics
      simulation is that the inner game clock has a larger error margin / a
      larger deviation than the real world clock, and that this causes
      artifacts in the physics simulation.
      Players tests will indicate if this is a choice to keep.
      If no value is set, default is false.

      minCullingDistance: (float) the minimum distance from the camera under which

      If no value is set, default is 500. It's useful if for example the skeleton
      origin is very near, behind the camera, but some parts of the skeleton
      are in front of the camera and need to be animated.

    <!-- ################# MAX SKELETONS NUMBER ########################### -->

      autoAdjustMaxSkeletons: (boolean) sets dynamically the maximum number of

      and maximumActiveSkeletons (below) to consume only the allocated
      percentageOfFrameTime.
      This can result in only one active skeleton when the load is heavy.
      The algorithm will prioritize closer skeletons within the center of your
      field of view.
      If disabled, fps may drop when you have too many active skeletons.
      If no value is set, default is true.

    <!--
      maximumActiveSkeletons: (int) the configured maximum number of

      autoAdjustMaxSkeletons is enabled. If autoAdjustMaxSkeletons is disabled,
      the maximum simultaneously active skeletons number is 10 (hardcoded).

    <!--
      percentageOfFrameTime: (int 1-100) [requires autoAdjustMaxSkeleton = true]
      percentage of the configured min-fps period allocated to additional physics calculus.

      Each frame, FSMP uses a certain time to calculate physics (T).
      Each frame, the work done by the Skyrim executable can be split into 2 parts:
        one that can be parallelized with the FSMP calculus (T1),
        one that can't because it depend on it (T2).
      If the FSMP calculus T is shorter than T1, then physics doesn't cost any fps.
      If it is longer, the Skyrim executable must wait (T - T1) for the physics calculus to finish.

      This setting allows you to choose how much fps you're willing to lose to increase
      the number of skeletons with physics at the same time :)

      FSMP being heavily parallelized, adding a 10th skeleton on top of 9
      doesn't cost a lot, so you should do your tests with a reasonable number
      of skeletons (10?), and set this setting depending on what performance
      you want to have in a heavy context. Whiterun seems a good place.
      Absolutely check what happens with the log at level 4 (verbose);
      it depends A LOT on your personal setup.

      If your min-fps is 60 and your percentage is 30, then the allocated time
      for additional physics calculus during a frame is 1/60s * 30% = 5ms.

      If no value is set, default is 30, which is NOT optimized.

      This is used to log performance statistics and also used to calculate
      the processing time average used to limit the number of active skeletons.
      Increasing the sample size will flatten outliers but can slow adjustment
      responsiveness.
      The value must be equal or greater to 1.

      min-fps: (int 60-300), is the main frequency at which physics simulation will
      advance; in fact, it defines the main period of time at which the physics
      simulation will advance; (p=1/f). min-fps should never be configured
      under 60, or the bullet physics engine will badly bug. The higher it is,
      the better your physics simulation will be and the more costly for your
      CPU/GPU. 120 costs twice as much cpu as 60.

    <!--
      maxSubSteps: (int, 1-60) this setting allows you to choose between fps and
      physics simulation quality, at low fps.
      maxSubSteps is the maximum number of physics calculus steps, each frame.
      Slowdowns are experienced when fps are below min-fps/maxSubSteps.
      With the default value, slowdowns are experienced below 60/4 = 15 fps.
      The higher it is, the more costly your physics simulation will be at low
      fps. 2 substeps cost twice as 1 substep.
      When fps are above min-fps, one substep is enough; when fps are between
      min-fps/n and min-fps/(n+1), n+1 substeps are necessary.
      The max value is 60, which allows for slowdowns below 5 fps when min-fps
      is at 300 (max value).
